/*
    Description: Central Collection for a large number of OlympicPin
                 NFTs

    This resource object looks and acts exactly like a OlympicPin PieceCollection
    and (in a sense) shouldnâ€™t have to exist! 

    The problem is that Cadence currently has a limitation where 
    storing more than ~100k objects in a single dictionary or array can fail.

    Most PieceCollections are likely to be much, much smaller than this, 
    and that limitation will be removed in a future iteration of Cadence, 
    so most people will never need to worry about it.

    However! The main OlympicPin administration account DOES need to worry about it
    because it frequently needs to mint >10k Pieces for sale,
    and could easily end up needing to hold more than 100k Piece at one time.
    
    Until Cadence gets an update, that leaves us in a bit of a pickle!

    This contract bundles together a bunch of PieceCollection objects 
    in a dictionary, and then distributes the individual Pieces between them 
    while implementing the same public interface 
    as the default PieceCollection implementation. 

    If we assume that piece IDs are uniformly distributed,
    a ShardedCollection with 10 inner Collections should be able 
    to store 10x as many pieces (or ~1M).

    When Cadence is updated to allow larger dictionaries, 
    then this contract can be retired.
