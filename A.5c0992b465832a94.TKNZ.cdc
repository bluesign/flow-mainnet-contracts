/*
    Description: Central Smart Contract for TKNZ

    This smart contract contains the core functionality for TKNZ

    The contract manages the data associated with all the plays and drops
    that are used as templates for the TKNZ NFTs

    When a new Play wants to be added to the records, an Admin creates
    a new Play struct that is stored in the smart contract.

    Then an Admin can create new Drops. Drops consist of a public struct that 
    contains public information about a drop, and a private resource used
    to mint new NFTs based off of plays that have been linked to the Drop.

    The admin resource has the power to do all of the important actions
    in the smart contract. When admins want to call functions in a drop,
    they call their borrowDrop function to get a reference 
    to a drop in the contract. Then, they can call functions on the drop using that reference.
    
    When NFTs are minted, they are initialized with a NFTData struct and
    are returned by the minter.

    The contract also defines a Collection resource. This is an object that 
    every TKNZ NFT owner will store in their account
    to manage their NFT collection.

    The main TKNZ account will also have its own NFT collections
    it can use to hold its own NFTs that have not yet been sent to a user.

    Note: All state changing functions will panic if an invalid argument is
    provided or one of its pre-conditions or post conditions aren't met.
    Functions that don't modify state will simply return 0 or nil 
    and those cases need to be handled by the caller.
