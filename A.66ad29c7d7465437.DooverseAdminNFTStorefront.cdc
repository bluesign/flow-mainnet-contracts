// DooverseAdminNFTStorefront
//
// What's the difference between this contract and the general-purpose NFTStorefront contract?
//
//  1. The storefront's admin (i.e. the account that this contract is deployed to) is the only entity that 
//     can install this storefront.
//
//  2. Each account that wants to buy packs of NFTs from the admin account can borrow a public capability to
//     the admin's storefront and call the purchase function (just like in the standard storefront contract).
//
//  3. The admin can "resolve" a listing, which removes the listing from the storefront and assigns its 
//     "purchased" status to either true or false (this functionality helps with fiat purchases).
//
//  4. Listings can now have a price of 0.
//
//  5. The admin can sell NFTs in groups of packs, and each pack can be further grouped under a set.
//     In other words, this contract uses a twist on data sharding, which allows the admin to store
//     more listings than the default storefront contract.
//
//  6. NFTs are minted directly to the user once a listing is purchased. When an admin creates a listing,
//     he/she will provide a list of NFT metadata dictionaries. The data in these dictionaries will 
//     become the NFT metadata when the listing is accepted. In the general-purpose NFTStorefront, 
//     NFTs need to be minted before they can be listed. This can be a bit constraining. To see why, 
//     suppose we wanted to sell 1,000,000+ NFTs. Not only would we need a large amount of FLOW
//     tokens to store them all in our account, but it isn't guaranteed that all 1,000,000+ will 
//     be bought. As a result, we'd be stuck with all the inventory in the event that no one buys
//     anything. Plus, if we wanted to list more NFTs for sale to make up for our tragic loss, we
//     would need to get even more FLOW tokens and use up even more space!
//
//  7. Once the user purchases a listing from the Admin, they can re-sell their newly bought NFTs using 
//     the general-purpose Flow NFTStorefront contract (or any other one for that matter).
//
//  8. A pack of NFTs can only be linked to one listing. However, each listing consists of an 
//     array of payment options which specifies the fungible tokens that can be used to purchase
//     the pack of NFTs along with other data such as the price and sale cut distribution.
//
// Besides that, this contract is mostly the same. Each Listing can have one or more "cut"s of 
// the sale price that goes to one or more addresses. Cuts can be used to pay listing fees or 
// other considerations. Each NFT may be listed in one or more Listings, the validity of each 
// Listing can easily be checked.
// 
// Purchasers can watch for Listing events and check the NFT type and ID to see if they wish to buy
// the listed item. Marketplaces and other aggregators can watch for Listing events and list items 
// of interest.
