    Description: Contract definitions for users to sell and buy their DarkCountry NFTs

    authors: Ivan Kravets evan@dapplica.io

    Marketplace is where users can create a sale collection that they
    store in their account storage. In the sale collection,
    they can put their NFTs up for sale with a price and publish a
    reference so that others can see the sale.

    If another user sees an NFT that they want to buy,
    they can send fungible tokens that equal or exceed the buy price
    to buy the NFT. The NFT is transferred to them when
    they make the purchase.

    Each user who wants to sell NFTs will have a sale collection
    instance in their account that holds the NFTs that they are putting up for sale

    They can give a reference to this collection to a central contract
    so that it can list the sales in a central place

    When a user creates a sale, they will supply four arguments:
    - A DarkCountry.Collection capability that allows their sale to withdraw
      a NFT when it is purchased.
    - A FungibleToken.Receiver capability as the place where the payment for the token goes.
    - Item ID as the identifier of the item for sale
    - Price of the item for sale

    DarkCountry Market has smart contract level setting that are managed by an account with Admin resource.
    Such setting are as follows:
    - beneficiaryCapability: A FungibleToken.Receiver capability specifying a beneficiary,
        where a cut of the purchase gets sent.
    - cutPercentage: A cut percentage, specifying how much the beneficiary will recieve.
    - preOrders: A dictionary of Adress to {ItemTemplate : number of preordered items} mapping that indicates
        how many items of a specific Item Template are resevred for the Address


    Only Admins can create sale offers wich can be used in pre-sales only. Such offers can not be accepted by users
    that do not have records in the preOrders. Once such sale is accepted, the preOrders value is adjusted accordingly.
